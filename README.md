## Intro
This plugin serves as a demonstration example of coding standards.  
It contains sample implementations intended to illustrate the recommended coding style, 
structure, and best practices to be followed throughout the project.  
 
This documentation is inspired by the [SplashDamage Coding Standards](https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards)  

## Starting point
The project includes both C++ and Blueprint standards  
- For C++ documentation see [CurrentActor.h](https://github.com/RadYarn/Coding-Standards/blob/main/Source/CodingStandards/Public/Actors/CurrentActor.h)/[cpp](https://github.com/RadYarn/Coding-Standards/blob/main/Source/CodingStandards/Private/Actors/CurrentActor.cpp)
